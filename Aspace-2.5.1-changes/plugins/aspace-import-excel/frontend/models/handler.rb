# this is the base class for handling objects that  must be linked to
# Archival Objects, such as Subjects, Top Containers, etc.

# a lot of this is adapted from Hudson Mlonglo's Arrearage plugin:
#https://github.com/hudmol/nla_staff_spreadsheet_importer/blob/master/backend/converters/arrearage_converter.rb

# One of the main differences is that we do lookups against the database for objects (such as agent, subject) that
# might already be in the database

  end


  # returns nil, a hash of a jason model (if 1 found), or throws a multiples found error
  # if repo_id is nil, do a global search (subject and agent)
  # this is using   archivesspace/frontend/app/models/search.rb
