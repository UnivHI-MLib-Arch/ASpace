# ASpace
Contains various customizations to ArchivesSpace at UHML

Notes:

  * The files in the "AS-changes" folder date from late June through early July 2018, and include/document the changes made to the ASpace 2.4.0 / 2.4.1 test server.
  
  * The files in the "2.5.1" folder date from late October through early November 2018 and were created in preparation for a 2.5.1 test server (spun up in fall 2018); as such not all files represent their final versions / the actual changes ultimately implemented in the production 2.5.1 instance.

  * Various additional config file changes (to improve PUI search results) were implemented in June 2021; these are not separately reflected in their own update folder, but are instead subsumed in the config file for the first of the 2024 updates (i.e. from 2.5.1 to 2.7.1).

  * As of May 2024, the folder for the 2024 updates is still a work in progress.

  * (Finally, ignore the 'July 3rd' [2018] branch.)
