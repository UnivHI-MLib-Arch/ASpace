# ASpace at UHML

Contains various customizations to ArchivesSpace at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Library.

Notes:

* "AS-changes" folder: Files date from late June through early July 2018, and include/document the changes made to the ASpace 2.4.0 / 2.4.1 test server.
  
* "Aspace-2.5.1-changes" folder: Files date from late October through early November 2018 and were created in preparation for a 2.5.1 test server (spun up in fall 2018); as such not all files represent their final versions / the actual changes ultimately implemented in UHML's production 2.5.1 instance.

* Note: Various additional config file changes (to improve PUI search results) were implemented in June 2021; these are not separately reflected in their own update folder, but are instead subsumed in the config file for the first of the 2024 updates (i.e. "2024_upgrades/v2_7_1/").

* "2024_upgrades" folder: As of June 2024, still a work in progress.
