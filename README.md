# ASpace
Contains various customizations to ArchivesSpace at UHML

Notes:

  * The files in the "AS-changes" folder date from late June through early July 2018, and include/document the changes made to the ASpace 2.4.0 / 2.4.1 test server.
  
  * The files in the "2.5.1" folder date from late October through early November 2018; current files are created in preparation for a 2.5.1 test server (expected spin up date: 10/29/2018); files created after that date will document/include actual changes made.

  * Note to self: When putting together the "2.5.1" folder, remember to look for & use the latest version, NOT the one that's in the "AS-changes" folder

  * (Also, ignore the 'July 3rd' branch!)
