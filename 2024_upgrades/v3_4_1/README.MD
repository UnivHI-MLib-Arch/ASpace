# Codebase for UHM Library Upgrade from 2.7.1 to 3.4.1

- Notable changes:
  - refactoring previous plugins and customizations to streamline them and make them align with ASpace best practice (e.g. making changes via plugins rather than via changes to core code)
  - dropping former plugins that have now been implemented in the core code (e.g. spreadsheet batch import)
  - other assorted minor bugfixes and feature improvements (e.g. making UHML logo a clickable button)
  - all other changes entailed in upgrading ASpace from v. 2.7.1 to v. 3.4.1. (see the ASpace-Docs repo for more detail)
