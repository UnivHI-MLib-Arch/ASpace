# Codebase for UHM Library Upgrade from 2.5.1 to 2.7.1

- Notable changes (see the ASpace-Docs repo for more detail):
  - new plugin, langscript_batchupdate (i.e. local name for the ASpace batch_update_lang_and_script plugin)
  - change to the plugins line of the config.rb file to add langscript_batchupate to the list of loaded plugins
  - all the changes entailed in upgrading ASpace from v. 2.5.1 to v. 2.7.1, most notably the new language field requirements.
