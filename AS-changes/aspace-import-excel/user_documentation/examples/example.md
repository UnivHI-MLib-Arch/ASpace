# An Example of Using aspace-import-excel

Included in this directory are two spreadsheets which you can use to follow the step-by-step description below, where you create an empty Resource, populate it with the first spreadsheet, then add to it with the second.

## Create a new Resource

Create a new Resource of type **Collection**. You make it as minimal as you like, but you must assign an EAD ID of **hl_test_ingest**.  Don't create any archival objects for it.

## Loading the First Spreadsheet

<img alt="the empty resource in edit mode" src="images/empty_collection_edit.png"/>


### <a name="first">Select the Spreadsheet</a>

With your new Resource in *edit* mode, click on the "Load via Spreadsheet" button.

<img alt="the 'Load Spreadsheet Popup'" src="images/load_popup.png"/>


Click on the **Add File** button, and select the **empty_test_collection.xlsx** file, that you've downloade from <a href="empty_test_collection.xlsx">here</a> . This spreadsheet creates two top level "Series" Archival Objects; the second Archival Object will also have a child "Item" object.  There are a few errors in the spreadsheet, so that you can see the error reporting mechanism.  

This spreadsheet has specified an Agent by the Agent ID of 3760.  If you don't have an Agent with that ID, an agent will be created, with the header of "PLACEHOLDER FOR person agent ID 3760 NOT FOUND", and reported as such in the results.
It also specifies a subject with the ID of 837, but also specifies the term, type, and source.  If you don't have a subject with that ID, a new subject will be created based on that information; again, it will be reported in the results.



Here's what it looks like from an MS Windows view:

### Click "Import From Spreadsheet"

The importer will "gray out" that button, and begin processing.  When it is completed, you will see a confirmation pop-up:
<img alt="the confirmation popup" src="images/empty_collection_finished_popup.png"/>

Click "OK", and you will be presented with the report of the results:
<img alt="results of the first load" src="images/empty_collection_results.png"/>

### Copying the results

If you click on the "Copy to Clipboard" button, you will get a "Copied" confirmation popup.  You will now have
 get a tabbed copy of the results in your clipboard, which you can then paste into a text file, Word document, Excel spreadsheet, etc.  We've pasted it into an Excel spreadsheet, which we've also <a href="results/first_ss_report.xlsx">uploaded to GitHub</a>:
<img alt="image of spreadsheet paste" src="images/first_ss_report.png"/>

### <a name="ad_error">Addressing errors</a>

Reading the results, you will see that the processing of each Archival Object did not go smoothly.  For example, for the object **"The Early Years,1990 - 1995"**, a Container instance was not created because there was a problem with the container *child type*. 

You can interactively create a Container instance for that object.  We suggest you use the Top Container ("Box 1") that was created, because it's referenced in the next spreadsheet.  Otherwise, a second free-standing "Box 1" Top Container will be created when the second spreadsheet is run.

Similarly, you can edit the other two objects, if you like.


## Adding Children and Siblings to the new Resource

### Select Your Upload Point

With your Resource in **edit** mode, select the "**The Early Years, 1990 - 1995**" archival object.

### Load Spreadsheet

As <a href="#first">above</a>, click on "Load via Spreadsheet", add the **add_to_hl_test_ingest_collection.xlsx** file that you've downloaded from <a href="add_to_hl_test_ingest_collection.xlsx">here</a>, then click on "Import from SpreadSheet".

This spreadsheet also specifies Agent ID 3760.  If you already had an agent with the ID, that is what will be assigned to it; otherwise, the agent created by the ingest of the previous spreadsheet will be used.  Similarly, the subject ID 837 is referenced as well, and treated the same.

### Results

These are the expected results: 
<img alt="results of second import" src="images/add_ss_load_report.png"/>

If you had not edited the "**The Early Years, 1990 - 1995**" archival object to add the Container instance, as described <a href="#ad_errors">above</a>, you will also see a "Top Container [box 1] created..." message.

These results also were copied and pasted into an Excel spreadsheet:

<img alt="snapshot of second load results" src="images/add_load_report_in_xls.png" />

We have also uploaded the actual spreadsheet <a href="results/add_ss_load_report.xlsx">here</a>.

And here's a view of the Resource's "tree" after the two spreadsheets have been loaded:
